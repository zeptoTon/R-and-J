# R-and-J
Demo of R series (Redux, Rx, Reactive) with Pure Javascript


## What is this about
I am trying to illustrate the essential part of a JavaScript developer. Not any named frameworks can justisfy the quality of a developer unless this developer acquire the **beauty of JavaScript**.

## How to illustrate
This repo contains a simple application written in **Pure JavaScript**. I am going to rewrite everything from scratch using one of the R _(Redux, Rx, Reactive)_ and non-R _(Cycle.js, Elm)_. For each rewrite, there will be a guidebook inside the developer console (Chrome F12). The guidebook will cover what result has accomplished (pros, cons, perf, times etc.)

## Application Feature
* async fetch resource
* table, filter
* onclick
* onscroll
* form, validation
* put State, replace state
* image slider
